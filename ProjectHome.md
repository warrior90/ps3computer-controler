This project's aim is to make it possible to connect a linux box with the playstation through usb or bluetooth and be able to use it with a mapping of keys to ps3 buttons and/or joysticks and a mapping of the mouse to a joystick.
This is a pet project of mine so if you are a developer and are interested, your help is welcome. For now development will be just slow...
